## HireUp - Backend API in Flask

### Set Up
- Use _Homebrew_ to set up a Python virtual environment (we used `pyenv`) to avoid using the default Python distribution on your machine, install `Python 3` as well as `pip`, a package manager, and set the latest version of both as the global default inside `pyenv`. These [instructions](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac#what-to-do) were helpful.
- Clone down repo
- `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
